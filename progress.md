# NOS Project Progress

## Current Status: Phase 1 (Core Language Implementation)

### Completed Milestones ✓
- **ANTLR4 Grammar Definition**: Robust grammar for `.nos`, `.node`, and `.interface` files.
- **Operator Precedence**: Corrected mathematical and logical precedence in the grammar (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
- **AST Construction**: Labeled AST building logic that ensures 1:1 mapping between parse tree and typed nodes.
- **Environment Modernization**: Dev environment updated to Java 21 and Go 1.26.2.
- **Basic Python Codegen**: Initial framework for generating ROS2 Python nodes.
- **CLI Entry Point**: Functional `nos` compiler interface.
- **Semantic Analysis Hardening**: (Issue #5) Implemented struct member access validation and alias resolution for imports.
- **Diagnostic Improvements**: (Issue #4) Integrated ANTLR4 syntax errors into the compilation pipeline.
- **Qualified Type Validation**: (Issue #2) Hardened validation for `pkg::Type` structures across imports.
- **Callback Syntax & Events**: (Issue #6) Fully implemented and verified callback syntaxes and custom events.

### In Progress 🚧
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 
    - [x] Unit test coverage for all expression types.
    - [x] Integration tests for callback syntax and custom events (Issue #6).
    - [x] End-to-end validation of generated ROS2 nodes.
    - [ ] Stress testing with complex/nested launch configurations.
- **C++ Code Generation**: (Phase 2)
- **LSP / IDE Support**: Syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
- **Colcon Integration**: Seamless build pipeline.

## Known Limitations
- Expressions within `PYTHON_CODE` blocks are handled as raw strings by the DSL; the internal Python logic is not parsed by the NOS compiler.
- Current validation for ROS2 naming conventions is basic and needs hardening.
